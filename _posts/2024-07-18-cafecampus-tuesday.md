Café Campus, founded in 1967, is a bar, nightclub, performance hall, and work cooperative. We have two rooms to host various types of events: Café Campus and Petit Campus. All our events are reserved for those aged 18 and over.

We are located a few minutes walk from the Sherbrooke metro stations on the orange line and Saint-Laurent on the green line. Several bus lines pass near us, including the 24 Sherbrooke and the 55 Saint-Laurent.
