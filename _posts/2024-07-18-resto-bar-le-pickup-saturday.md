Since 2008, Le Pick Up has aspired to build community and neighbourhood longevity through good food and drinks. 

Each location has a history. We strive to create spaces for the city that are contemporary, but donâ€™t erase the past. Our menu evolved from the tradition of lunch counters and canteens. We take familiar dishes, like the grilled cheese, and make it our own through using contemporary ingredients.
