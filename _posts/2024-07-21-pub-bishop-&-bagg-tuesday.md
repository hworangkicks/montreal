Pub Bishop & Bagg is a charming English-style pub nestled in the heart of Montreal's Mile-End neighborhood. Established by The Burgundy Lion Group, this local favorite offers a unique blend of traditional pub atmosphere and high-quality cuisine. The pub takes its name from two influential figures in Montreal's history: Monsignor Ignace Bourget, a former Bishop of Montreal, and Stanley Clark Bagg, a notable landowner and philanthropist.

At Bishop & Bagg, patrons can enjoy seasonal, pub-inspired dishes made with fresh ingredients, alongside a wide selection of imported beers and carefully curated drinks. The pub prides itself on being an authentic, locally owned establishment that strives to bring a slice of British pub culture to Montreal while maintaining its independence and commitment to quality. With regular events like Sunday pub trivia and Tuesday karaoke nights, Bishop & Bagg offers a lively and welcoming atmosphere for locals and visitors alike.
