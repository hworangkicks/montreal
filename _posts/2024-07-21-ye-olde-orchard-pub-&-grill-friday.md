Ye Olde Orchard Pub & Grill is a beloved chain of cozy Celtic pubs that has been serving the Montreal area since 1996. Founded in the heart of Monkland Village, this friendly establishment has expanded to multiple locations across Quebec, including Downtown Montreal, the Plateau, Pointe-Claire, Saint-Sauveur, and Chateauguay.

Known for its warm and inviting atmosphere, Ye Olde Orchard offers patrons a taste of Ireland with its woody decor, emblems, and occasional live Celtic music. The pub prides itself on serving hearty pub fare, including popular dishes like fish and chips, Irish stew, and braised beef, alongside a great selection of beers and drinks.

Recently, the chain has undergone a slight rebranding, dropping the 'Ye Olde' from its main signage to comply with Quebec's language laws. Now simply known as 'Orchard,' the pub continues to maintain its Celtic charm and commitment to providing a welcoming environment for locals and visitors alike
